# Book Survey Data Web Application

Allows users to submit new data to, and query a database storing responses to a survey about
favorite books. Made with HTML and JavaScript.

## Improvements I could make:
- Currently there's no styling and the layout isn't very thought out. Add some basic styling and make better use of page space
- Query data is being shown as raw Json, so a simple improvement is to format them into html tables
- No feedback is provided if that database is empty or a query for a non-existent id is made, a simple message explaining this would be helpful
- Possibly use a framework such as React (which I have some experience with) or Angular (read about better performance and efficiency)
