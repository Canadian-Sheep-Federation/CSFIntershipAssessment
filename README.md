# CSFInternshipAssessment - Software Developer Position

I've included the API and Web-App that I wrote for this assessment. Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the Web-App and 
it's missing the ability to query a public API. I was planning on using the Google Book's API but I ran out of time.

I had a bit of knowledge about express comming into this assessment but I've had to learn much of it as I worked so I've provided comments about 
improvements I should make based on what I've read. I definitely don't expect it to be on par with some of the other submissions,
